> [!NOTE]
> At the time of writing, no specific API endpoints have been fully implemented. This document serves as a foundational outline and will be updated with detailed information and examples as the API development progresses.

- **Endpoint Definitions:** Clear descriptions of each available API endpoint.
- **HTTP Methods:** Specification of the HTTP method used for each endpoint (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Request Parameters:** Details on any required or optional parameters that need to be included in the API requests (e.g., in the URL path, query parameters, or request body). This will include parameter names, types, descriptions, and whether they are mandatory.
- **Request Body:** For endpoints that accept data in the request body (e.g., POST, PUT), the expected format (e.g., JSON) and the structure of the data will be described, including field names, types, and descriptions.
- **Response Format:** Information about the structure and format of the responses returned by the API (e.g., JSON). This will include the different fields in the response, their types, and their meanings.
- **Status Codes:** A list of possible HTTP status codes that can be returned by each endpoint, along with their explanations (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Details on how to authenticate with the API and the necessary authorization mechanisms to access specific endpoints.
- **Example Requests and Responses:** Practical examples of how to make API calls using tools like `curl` or JavaScript's `fetch`, along with example responses to illustrate the expected data structure.
